# Quantum Project 3: Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm

## Task 1: Building a Balanced Oracle with OpenQasm 3

In this task, you are required to implement a balanced oracle using OpenQasm 3 for the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm.

### Steps:
1. by Study the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm you  understand its working principles and the role of the oracle.
2. Design a quantum circuit to create a balanced oracle for the problem.
3. Clearly explain the design choices and the reasoning behind them in your code comments.
4. Test the oracle using various inputs to verify its balanced behavior.

## Task 2:  Signing Up for IBM Quantum Lab and Using Python Notebook

In this task, you will sign up for IBM Quantum Lab and utilize a Python notebook for the given problem.

### Steps:
1. Go to [IBM Quantum Lab](https://lab.quantum-computing.ibm.com/) and sign up for an account if you don't have one.
2. Set up your environment for using Python notebooks in the IBM Quantum Lab.
3. Import the necessary library for the Deutsch-Jozsa problem using the following code:
   
```python
from qiskit_textbook.problems import dj_problem_oracle
```
4. Design a quantum circuit to run  Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm on the given oracle .
4. Utilize the provided oracle as follows:
   
```python
dj_problem_oracle(4)
```

5. Run the notebook cells to observe the output and understand the behavior of the oracle.
6. Document your findings and any observations in the notebook itself.

Ensure that you provide detailed explanations and comments at each step, making it easy for others to understand your work. Use clear language and include any assumptions made during the implementation. Good luck!
